## 1. Get Unstuck

### How to spot the conversations that are keeping you from what you want

> If you don't talk it out, you will act it out

#### Q. How did you get your way as a child?

On a continuum of communication with silence at one end, violence at the other, and the healthy realm of dialogue in the middle:

**Silence** <== dialogue ==> **Violence**

- Too Silent = Results in burnout / stress / get walked over
- Too Violent = Results in difficult to work with / backlash / excluded

### Pool of Shared Meaning:

> The facts, experiences, opinions, and feelings held by participants in a conversation that are understood by all parties.

#### Q. What makes a conversation crucial?

1. Opposing Opinions
2. Strong Emotions
3. High Stakes

#### Q. When do we go to Silence and Violence?

### The Low of Crucial Conversations

> Anytime you find yourself stuck, there's a crucial conversation you're either not holding or not holding well.

##### 1. Identify where you're stuck

> **Stuck** : A chronic inability to solve problems or achieve aspirations or goals.

- What bad results do you want to fix?
- What good results are you currently unable to achieve?
- What problem are you always trying to fix?
- What do people complain about at home and at work?

##### 2. Unbundle with CPR

- Content
  - One off/ immediate consequences
- Pattern
  - Repeated issue
- Relationship
  - Relation between the parties

When you're using CPR, always focus on one. Ultimately we want to get the result by remaining in the dialogue.

### Exercises:

##### Professional

- Content: Too many meetings / Not enough support on COVID leaves
- Pattern: Not enough energy and time to manage many meetings
- Relationship: N/A

---

- Content: Can't get enough people to actively participate in the PR review
- Pattern: Too many PR happening at the same time from two pods / Too many merges delaying the merge
- Relationship: Two pods working on the same project / Everyone is working on their own task individually

##### Personal

- Content: Family members wanting to chat over some issue
- Pattern: Always not enought time to deal with the topic and postponing the issue causes more trouble
- Relationship: Family members expecting instant help

---

- Content: Can't visit parents' house often
- Pattern: I'm always packed with too many things going on during the weekend
- Relationship: Have to spend some time with partner / Have to spend time with parents

## 2. Start with Heart

### How to stay focused on what you really want

> The reason others get defensive with use is not because we lack the right skills, but because we have the wrong motives. Change what you want and you'll change how you act.

### How do we avoid moving to silence and violence

- How to get our _heart_ right by understanding what it is we really want
- How to get our _head_ right by mastering our stories and creating new emotions that help us return to dialogue.

##### Exercise:

- What I was thinking OR feeling but didn't say
  - 'I don't understand how that will even make it work'
  - 'Surely there's a better way to fix this issue'
  - 'I wonder if anyone else also agrees on what he is talking about..'
- What was actually said
  - "Do you really think that's a good idea?"
    - "Yes, I've givent it a lot of thought"
  - "Okay, if that's what you really want to do."
  - "Could you please explain why it needs to be written in such way?"
  - "Could there be a better way to refactor this method?"
  - "Have you thought of other way to approach to solve this issue? What are they?"

### Focus on what you _really_ want

> When we're under attack, our emotions can take over. We rely on our 'reptilian brain' and we become horrible self-monitors.
> Re-engage your brain by focusing on what you really want

| Unhealthy Motives | Motives of dialogue      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| Be right          | Learn                    |
| Win               | Find the truth           |
| Punish, Blame     | Produce results          |
| Avoid conflict    | Strengthen relationships |

> _Unhealthy motives is a short term, whilst dialogue is a long term._

### How to restart your brain

1. "What does your behaviour look like you want?"
2. "What do you really want for yourself/others/the relationship/organisation"
3. "What could you say to make clear of what you really want?"

#### Exercise:

"What were you behaving like you wanted?"

- Behaving like she wants to have some time and not deal with it

"What did you really want for yourself, for others, for the relationship, or for the organisation"

- She wanted to have a mutual agreement to discuss the issue later when she had more time to think about

"What could you say to make what you really wanted clear?"

- "???"

## 3. Master My Stories

### How to stay in dialogue when you're angry, scared, or hurt

> The central skill for taking control of the quality of your life and the quality of your relationships is the ability to master your stories.

**Problem** : When it matters most and emotions kick in, we do our worst -- and we feel like we're doing the right thing.

**Solution** : Learn how to create emotions that make you want to return to healthy dialogue.

##### Exercise:

- Some of the types of people you find most difficult
  - refuses to take ownership of a problem
  - stubborn / close minded
  - narcisist
  - passive
  - sarcastic / negative

### The path to action

Our stories create our emotions -- We create our stories

- `See & Hear` => `Tell a story` => `Feel` => `Act`

### Use Three Skills to help you master your stories!

- Skill #1: Separate Facts from Stories
- Skill #2: Watch for Three Clever Stories
- Skill #3: Tell the Rest of the Story

#### Skill #1 Separate Facts from Stories

**What is a fact?**
An actual occurence - Something that can be proven through observation or measurement.

**How are stories different from facts?**
Stories are judgements, conclusions, and attributions that we make from the facts.

> We tend to believe that the stories we tell are fact. We need to separate facts from stories to suspend judgement and open our minds to alternative stories.

#### Skill #2 Watch for Three Clever Stories

##### Three Clever Stories

1. Victim Stories
   "It's not my fault!"
2. Villain Stories
   "It's all your fault!"
3. Helpless Stories
   "There's nothing else i can do!"

#### Skill #3 Tell the Rest of the Story

- Tell the rest of the story to break away from strong emotions.
- Add valuable information.
  - Assess your role, humanize others, and turn yourself from helpless into able.
- Turn yourself from a Victim into a Contributor.
  - Ask yourself: "What am I pretending not to notice about my role in the problem?"
- Turn others from Villains into Humans
  - Seek to see other's good qualities. Assume the best by asking the 'humanizing question'
  - "Why would a reasonable, rational, and decent person do this?"
- Turn yourself from Helpless into Able
  - "What should I do right now to move toward what I really want?"
