## 1. Am I in a Crucial Conversation?

## 3. Let's Create a Story

> We tend to believe that the stories we tell are fact.
>
> Separate facts from stories

##### The Path To Action

| See & Hear | ➡️  | Tell a story | ➡️  | Feel | ➡️  | Act |
| ---------- | --- | ------------ | --- | ---- | --- | --- |

### SKILL: Master Your Stories! (Analyse) ✅

##### 1. Separate "Facts" from "Stories"

- Fact is an actual occurence that can be proven through observation/measurement.
- Stories are judgements/conclusions/attributions that we make _from_ the facts.

##### 2. Identify Three Clever Stories

1. Victim Stories: "It's not my fault!"
2. Villain Stories: "It's all your fault!"
3. Helpless Stories: "There's nothing else I can do!"

##### 3. Analyse the story

- Victim ➡️ Contributor
  - "Is there anything that I'm contributing to this problem?"
- Villains ➡️ Humans
  - "Why would a reasonable and decent person do this?"
- Helpless ➡️ Able
  - "Is there anything that I could do to move toward what I really want?"

## 4. Let's Tell a Story!

### How to speak persuasively, not abrasively

> You can argue as strongly as you want for your opinion as long as you are equally vigorous in encouraging others to disagree

### SKILL: STATE (Explain) ✅

> **Short Version**: Facts ➡️ Story ➡️ Ask

##### SHARE your facts

- What do you see?
  - e.g. "I noticed that..." / "The last three times we talked about this..." / "I was expecting this by 3pm but..."

##### TELL your story

- Explain why the facts are a concern
  - e.g. "It leads me to conclude that..." / "I believe that..." / "I start to think that..."

##### ASK for others' paths

- e.g. "How do you see it?" / "Can you help me better understand?" / "What's your view?"

##### TALK tentatively

- Allow others' stories to be shared
- Avoid absolutes

##### ENCOURAGE testing

- Remember to get more meaning into the pool
- Convince / Compel / Control

| Too Forceful                                     | More Tentative                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| "The fact of the matter is..."                   | "In my opinion..."                                        |
| "That's a dumb idea..."                          | "Maybe it would make more sense to..."                    |
| "The only reasonable option is to..."            | "I believe that what we should do is..."                  |
| "If I agreed with you, then we'd both be wrong." | "I'm wondering if that example applies to our company..." |

## 5. Identify Silence & Violence

### How to notice when safety is at risk

> We go to silence because we dread crucial conversations.
>
> We go to violence because we're unskilled at holding crucial conversations

**Silence** : Any action taken to withhold information from the pool of meaning

**Violence** : Any action taken to compel others toward your point of view

### SKILL: Signs of Silence / Violence (Carefully) ✅

##### Look for signs of silence / violence in yourself and others

- Watch out for
  - What **emotion** do you feel?
  - What **physical responses** do you notice?
  - How do you **behave**?

---

## 6. How to deal with Silence & Violence?

### How to make it safe to talk

> When you see silence or violence, step out of the conversation and restore safely.

#### Build Mutual Purpose

1. Step out of the content and address the safety concern
2. Create Mutual Purpose
3. Start again

|                | Clear problem         | Misunderstanding |
| -------------- | --------------------- | ---------------- |
| Mutual Purpose | Create Mutual Purpose | Contrast         |
| Mutual Respect | Apologise             | Contrast         |

### SKILL: Mutual Purpose (Safely) ✅

##### 1. Seek Mutual Purpose

- "Let's see if we can come up with some common objectives"

##### 2. Find the purpose

- "What are you trying to achieve?"
- "Why is it you want \_\_\_?"
- "Help me understand where you're coming from."

##### 3. Invent a Mutual Purpose

- Combine both purposes into Mutual Purpose
- Look for higher/longer-term purpose

##### 4. Brainstorm new strategies

- How to achieve the new purpose

### SKILL: Mutual Respect (Safely) ✅

##### 1. Apologise when appropriate

- When respect is violated

##### 2. Contrast to address misunderstanding

- Only use if you believe your intentions have been misunderstood
  - When you notice someone becoming defensive due to a Misunderstanding
  - When it is likely for someone to get defensive

---

## 7. Help them to leave Silence & Violence

> Help others leave silence / violence behind and join you in dialogue

### SKILL: AMPP (Sympathise) ✅

##### Ask - to get things rolling

- Invite them to share their thoughts and feelings
- Show genuine interest

##### Mirror - to confirm feelings

- Send a message : "I'm interested in you. I want to hear what's really going on"

##### Paraphrase - to acknowledge the story

- Restate in your own words what you just heard
- Don't parrot!

##### Prime - when you're getting nowhere

- Don't show alarm and be sincere
- "Is it something that I've done that got you upset"
- "It's okay to share what you're really thinking. I won't be offended"
