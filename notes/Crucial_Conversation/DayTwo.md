## 4. STATE My Path

### How to speak persuasively, Not abrasively

> You can argue as strongly as you want for your opinion as long as you are equally vigorous in encouraging others to disagree

**Problem** : During crucial conversations, we say things in exactly the wrong way.
**Solution** : Learn five skills for saying risky things in a way that minimizes defensiveness.

### STATE My Path

"What" Skills

- **S**HARE your facts
- **T**ELL your story

"How" Skills

- **A**SK for others' paths
- **T**ALK tentatively
- **E**NCOURAGE testing

#### SHARE your facts

- Start with what you see and hear
- You may need to include how that differs from your expectations
- This adds clarity
- e.g.
  - "I noticed that..."
  - "The last three times we talked about this..."
  - "I was expecting to receive this at 3pm, and it's not 4..."

**Benefits**

- Facts are facts
- Facts are more persuasive
- Facts are the least insulting
- Feelings and stories often keep us from facts

#### TELL your story

**Why tell your story?**

- Facts by themselves don't always paint the whole picture
- share your story when the other person might not be sure why the facts you're sharing are a concern
- e.g.
  - "It leads me to conclude that..."
  - "I believe that..."
  - "I start to think that..."

#### ASK for others' paths

- **Be humble**
  - Let others share new ideas and challenge your story
- **Fill the pool**
  - Everyone needs to share their views
  - Share your stories, and ask others to do the same
- e.g.
  - "How do you see it?"
  - "Can you help me better understand?"
  - "What's your view?"
- Don't
  - "Isn't that the case?"
  - "What can we do to make sure this doesn't happen again?"
  - "No on disagress with that, do they?"

#### TALK tentatively (subject to further confirmation)

- Share the facts and storiess tentatively
- Tell your story as a story, not a fact
- Allow room for others' stories to be shared
- Avoid absolutes

#### ENCOURAGE testing

| Too Forceful                                     | More Tentative                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| "The fact of the matter is..."                   | "In my opinion..."                                        |
| "That's a dumb idea..."                          | "Maybe it would make more sense to..."                    |
| "The only reasonable option is to..."            | "I believe that what we should do is..."                  |
| "If I agreed with you, then we'd both be wrong." | "I'm wondering if that example applies to our company..." |

- Remember your purpose:
  - to get more meaning into the pool
- If your goal is to convince, compel, or control
  - you'll do a good job of speaking your mind and a poor job of encouraging others!

### Use the skill "STATE my path" to share tough messages

1. Facts

- Share your facts with the person in the scenario

2. Story

- Tell your story

3. Ask

- Ask for the other person's path

## 5. Learn to Look

### How to notice when safety is at risk

> We go to silence because we dread crucial conversations. We go to violence because we're unskilled at holding crucial conversations

**Problem** : When a conversation turns crucial, we either miss or misinterpret the early warning signs.

**Solution** : The sooner we notice that we or others are not in dialogue, the quicker we can get back to dialogue and the lower the cost.

> Some people respond to deteriorating conditions quickly; some get sucked into silence or violence. If you want to be in the first category, make sure you're seeing what's happening.

#### Skill #1 Learn to look for when a conversation becomes crucial

**What are the signs to watch for?**

- What **emotions** do you feel?
- What **physical** responses do you notice?
- How do you **behave**?

#### Skill #2 Learn to look for signs of silence and violence in yourself and others

**Silence**

Any action taken to withhold information from the pool of meaning

**Violence**

Any action taken to compel others toward your point of view
