## 6. Make It Safe I

### How to make it safe to talk about almost anything

> The limiting factor of all communication is not the riskness of the message you want to share, but how safe you can help others feel hearing that message

**Problem** : People go to silence and violence because they feel unsafe sharing their meaning.

**Solution** : When you see silence or violence, step out of the conversation and restore safety.

### Make it safe

- People become defensive because of _why_ they think you're saying it
- People rarely become defensive about _what_ you're saying (the content)

1. **Step out of the content**

- Stop talking about the issue and address the safety concerns

2. **Rebuild safety**

- Mutual purpose
  - Both parties care about the same goals
  - This is the foundation of trust
- Mutual Respect
  - Both parties care about the same people
  * When respect is violated, safety breaks down

3. **Then step back in**

- Start the conversation again

### How to rebuild safety

|                | Clear problem         | Misunderstanding |
| -------------- | --------------------- | ---------------- |
| Mutual respect | Apologize             | Contrast         |
| Mutual Purpose | Create Mutual purpose | Contrast         |

#### Skill #1: Apologize when appropriate

When respect is violated, apologizing is the first step back toward dialogue.

#### Skill #2: Contrast to address misunderstandings

When others misunderstand you, step out of the content and rebuild safety using a skill called _contrasting_.

**When to use contrasting**

- Only use it if you believe your intentions have been misunderstood
- Don't use it to "soften the blow" when delivering a difficult message
  - When you notice someone becoming defensive due to a misunderstanding
  - When it is likely to get someone to becoming defensive

## 7. Make It Safe II

### How to create mutual purpose

> When others feel respected and trust your motives, they let their guard down and begin to listen.

**Problem** : When we find ourselves at cross-purposes, our automatic reaction is to either give in or dig in. These are exactly the wrong responses.

**Solution** : Learn how to step out of the content, create a Mutual Purpose, and return to healthy dialogue.

#### Skill: Create Mutual Purpose

Repairing violoations of Mutual Purpose requires a change of heart. Switch from digging in or giving in or giving in to creating a Mutual Purpose.

> When Mutual Purpose is at risk, take Four steps to establish Mutual Purpose

##### 1. Commit to seek Mutual Purpose

- Point out that you are at cross-purposes
- Commit to search for a goal that will benefit both of you
- E.g.
  - "Let's see if we can come up with some common objectives"

##### 2. Recognize the purpose behind the strategy

- Find the purpose by asking others _why_ they want what they want
- E.g.
  - "What are you trying to achieve?"
  - "Why is it you want \_\_\_\_\_?"
  - "Help me understand where you're coming from."

##### 3. Invent a Mutual Purpose

- Try to combine both purposes into a Mutual Purpose
- Look for higher-level or longer-term purpose

##### 4. Brainstorm new strategies

- Join forces and brainstorm mutually satisfactory strategies.

## 8. Explore Others' Paths

### How to listen when others blow up or clam up

> The best predictor of your ability to get dialogue is the amount of curiosity you bring to the conversation.

**Problem** : Others are feeling unsafe and have moved to either silence or violence -- and we're not sure why.

**Solution** : Learn to help others leave silence and violence behind and join you in dialogue by retracing their Path to Action

### Path to Action

| See & Hear | ->  | Tell A Story | ->  | Feel | ->  | Act |
| ---------- | --- | ------------ | --- | ---- | --- | --- |

- Allow time for others' emotions to catch up with your thoughts.
- Don't force others to retrace their path too quickly.

#### SKill : Explore with Added AMPPs

- **A**sk
- **M**irror
- **P**araphrase
- **P**rime

> The purpose of AMPP Skill is to make people willing to share their thoughts whene they feel unsafe.

> Join in dialogue with the AMPP Skills to help others leave silence/violence

##### ASK to get things rolling

- Invite them to share their thoughts and feelings
- Show genuine interest -- it helps people feel less need to use silence or violence.

##### MIRROR to confirm feelings

- Mirroring sends the message: "I'm interested in you. I want to hear what's really going on"

##### PARAPHRASE to acknowledge the story

- Restate in your own words what you just heard
- Don't parrot

##### PRIME when you're getting nowhere

- Don't show alarm and be sincere
- Make it safe to agree with your guess
  - "Is it something that I've done that has you upset?"
- Signal a message
  - "It's okay to share what you're really thinking and feeling. I won't be offended"

## 9. Move to Action

### How to turn crucial conversations into action and results

> The key to real change is not just to build a great process - It's for people to hold each other accountable to use the process and that requires crucial conversations.

**Problem** : When we finish off a crucial conversation, we often create a whole new set of problems by not ending well.

**Solution** : Learn how to move from talking to achieving the results you're after.

#### Skill: Document who does what by when and follow up

- Who
- Does what
- By When
- How we will follow up

##### Follow up

- Establish a specific way you'll follow up on what you agreed on

> To do: Follow up with Barry by end of May on Crucial Conversation training
