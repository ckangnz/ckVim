# Images

## Importing the image

1. Have the image ready
2. View > Tool Windows > Resource Manager or Resource Manager on the far left below Project tab
3. - (Add resource to the module) > Import Drawables
4. Select the image

> For photographs and background images (drawable-nodpi)

5. Set QUALIFIER TYPE to `Density`
6. Set VALUE to `No Density`
7. When the image is imported successfully, Android Studio adds the image under Drawable tab

## Accessing resources

Resources can be accessed with resource IDs that are generated in your project's `R` class.

```
  Subdirectory in res folder
    |     Resource ID(mostly same as filename)
    |        |
R.drawable.filename
|
Auto generated R class

```

## Image Composable

- [content scale](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/graphics/images/customize#content-scale)

```kotlin
import androidx.compose.foundation.Image

val image = painterResource(R.drawable.imageName)

Image(
  painter = image
  contentDescription = "Accessible name for the image"
  contentScale = ContentScale.Crop
  alpha = 0.5F
)
```
