# Extracting string resource

- When writing the apps, it's important to remember localisation
- You can extract strings into a resource file to resolve these issues

1. Extract the string as a resource

```kotlin
GreetingImage(message = "This string is hardcoded!")
                             |
                 right click then extract string resource
```

2. Name the resource to `snake_case_text`
3. Use the resource as `stringResource(R.string.snake_case_text)`
